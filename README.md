## Introduction

The airline industry relies heavily on passenger satisfaction for customer retention and competitive advantage. This project dives into understanding the factors of passenger satisfaction and proposes actionable insights to increase satisfaction levels.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains information on various aspects of the passenger experience, including flight amenities, customer service interactions, and overall satisfaction ratings. The data is sourced from Kaggle.

## Analysis

I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations within the dataset. Models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest were employed to predict passenger satisfaction based on feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.

## Results

Our analysis revealed several key findings:
- The most significant factors influencing passenger satisfaction include online_boarding, type_of_travel, customer_class, inflight_entertainment, seat_comfort, onboard_service, legroom_service, cleanliness. .
- Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 87% in predicting passenger satisfaction.
- Decision Tree achieved 94% accuracy
- Random Forest outperformed Decision trees and Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 96%.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project highlights the importance of understanding passenger satisfaction in the airline industry and compares performance and computational efficiency of three algorithms
